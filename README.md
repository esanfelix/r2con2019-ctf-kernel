# Kernel pwnable for r2con 2019 CTF 

This repository contains the challenge I contributed the r2con 2019 CTF. The 
challenge was not solved during the CTF, so I decided to also host it on 
github.

The repository contains the following folders:

* `challenge/` contains the files provided to the CTF participants. This is 
the only directory with contents at the moment.

* `source/`: in a week or two I will upload the source code of the pwnable 
here as well. I am not uploading it yet to give people some time to attempt 
solving the challenge exactly as it was provided during the CTF.

* `solution/`: will contain a write-up of my solution as well as the exploit 
to be used for reference purposes.
